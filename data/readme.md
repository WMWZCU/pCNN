Here we uploaded an image from Vaihingen dataset. Thanks for [ISPRS orgnization](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/2d-sem-label-vaihingen.html) 
who denote this precious dataset. 

Note that, in order to save storage space and computational costs, we've subsampled the original image to 1/4 of its orignial sizes. You can download the original
dataset and try our method without any shrink.
